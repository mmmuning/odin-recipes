      <h3>STEPS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Stir cucumber pieces and gochujang paste together in a bowl; set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and
          stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set
          spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir
          carrots until softened, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
          cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture
          aside in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5
          minutes per side; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over
          medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but
          whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach
          mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop
          each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle
          of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
