# ODIN RECIPES

This project is part of The Odin Project’s Foundations Course.
It’s a simple multi-page website that showcases several recipes, designed to apply everything I’ve learned from the HTML lessons.

### This project includes:

- A main index page that links to individual recipe pages
- Each recipe page contains a title, image with attribution, description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions
- Proper structure using semantic HTML elements

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Building structured web pages using HTML5
- Organizing files and linking pages with relative paths
- Using semantic elements for clarity and accessibility
- Adding images, lists, and links effectively
- Writing clean, readable, and well-formatted markup
